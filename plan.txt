Tentative Plan:

I believe that the MNE matlab code essentially works by minimizing the the 
distance between the spike-triggered average (STA) and spike-triggered covariance 
(STC) described by the neuronal response data and the STA/STC produced by the
p-vector while maximizing the entropy (function of p-vector, stimulus, and response).

It seems that this is done by:
1. Using log loss gradient to determine direction in which to move p-vector
== moves p-vector so as to reduce difference in STA/STC from neuronal response.
2. How far the p-vector is moved in the direction from (1) depends on the
the distance along this vector that minimizes the log-loss function.

Thus, it seems that we should be able to use log_loss and d_log_loss functions
along with the python gradient descent method 
(http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.fmin_tnc.html)
to implement pyMNE.
